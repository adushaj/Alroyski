# Alvksi
> A DiscordJS Bot for random team scrimmages

## About

There are many web applications that you can find online that will take a list of names from your input and randomly shuffle them into groups of any size you desire. The particular usage for this would be within a video game clan Discord where team scrimmages occur. Gather all of your clan members into a voice channel, execute a command to Alvksi, and watch as the players are randomly drafted into two teams of 1-6 players and moved to their team voice channels. Then you are ready to play.

> Note: The ability to tell Alvksi how many players you want per team instead of 3 will be coming soon.

## Setup/Requirements
1. Voice channels properly named
  - Create a voice channel named "Pregame"
  - Create 2 or more voice channels with "Team" included somewhere in the name. Names like "Team 1" or "Alpha Team" will work.
